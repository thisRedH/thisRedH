# thisRedH - Matthias

**`Self-taught Computer enthusiast`**

I am a Digital Craftsman with a broad range of interests within computer science, including: computer graphics, administration, Security, PC hardware, and much more. I love learning and tinkering with new things, in every direction.

My goal is to become a low-level developer, focusing on the creation of game engines or operating systems. However, if this is not possible, I am prepared to fall back as an application or backend developer, as these fields still align with my passion for coding and technology.

<details><summary>Note</summary>
&emsp;I have a special talent in the art of Yak Shaving.<br>
&emsp;So if you ever find me tangled up in some seemingly unrelated tasks, rest assured,<br>
&emsp;I'm probably just on an adventurous quest to optimize my coding universe!
