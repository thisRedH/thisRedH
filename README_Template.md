# thisRedH - Matthias

**`Self thought Computer enthusiast`**

I am a Digital Craftsman with a broad range of interests within computer science, including: computer graphics, physics, computer vision, Linux/server administration, Docker, PC hardware, and much more.

My dream is to become a low-level developer, focusing on the creation of game engines and operating systems. However, if this is not possible, i am prepared to fall back as an application or server developer, as these fields still align with my passion for coding and technology.
